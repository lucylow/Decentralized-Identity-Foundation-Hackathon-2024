# ZKURE : VC Gated Dapp

Schema Hash
The Schema Hash is a unique identifier for a Claim Schema. It is derived by hashing the string that represents unique identifier @id of the Claim Schema type. In the previous example, the hash pre-image is the string https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iden3/claim-schema-vocab/main/schemas/json-ld/kyc-v4.jsonld#KYCAgeCredential. ` For example, in the case of the Auth Claim the schema hash would be


var sHash core.SchemaHash
h := Keccak256([]byte("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iden3/claim-schema-vocab/main/schemas/json-ld/kyc-v4.jsonld#KYCAgeCredential"))
copy(sHash[:], h[len(h)-16:])
sHashHex, _ := sHash.MarshalText()
fmt.Println(string(sHashHex))
